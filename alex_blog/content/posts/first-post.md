## Why?
No better time than the present. 
I'm at a point in my life where the ratio of: **Accumulated Wisdom : Life Commitment** is at a local maximum. So why not take some time to explore the world outside of the code mines - right?
I want to spend more time on hobbies and things I don't have enough time to do while workng full time. 


## Plans
Perhaps the secret to getting things done is saying what you want to get done, then doing it. So here are some things that I want to accomplish. 
Barely any of them involve coding. 

 1. Open a Pop-Up Cafe or Leathercraft Business (or both)
 2. Evolve photography skills by:
    - Get paid to take wedding photographs (maybe as a second shooter)
    - Get paid to take product photographs
    - Attend a fine art photography workshop 
    - (maybe) Put together a photobook
 3. Make some content on some fun topics like: 
    - Thrifting in San Francisco
    - Home Cafe
 4. Finish a 2000pt Tyranid Army in time for the 10th Edition 40K release
 5. Explore Generative AI 
    - Run Image Generation algorithms locally
    - Train GPT to do something fun.
