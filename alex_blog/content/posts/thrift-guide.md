## Introduction
Thrifting and stooping is a recreation that runs in the family (thanks Dad lol). Here are some things I find important when rummaging for finds. 

### Rule of Cool
> The principle that anything is acceptable to do, use, wear etc. just as long as it is cool.

This is the most important thing! It should be fun to go and hunt for new treasure. If you think something is cool, then just ignore everything and do your thing. 

## Value Triangle
 - Inexpensive Price
 - High Quality Item
 - Fast Find

You can't get all three at the same time.[^1] I tend to look for Inexpensive and High Quality stuff, although sometimes you can just get lucky. [^2] This means that you should expect frequent misses; **not every trip will result in a find**. 

## Clothing

### High Quality
Look for the garment's care tag. Usually located near the inner waistband for pants, inner pocket for jackets, or inner side seam for shirts.

The immediate things that I look for here are: 

 - Material
   - Heavyweight Denim? Selvage? Nice.
   - Silk? Merino? Cashmere? Nice.
   - Gore-Tex? Nice.
   - Acrylic? Not Nice.
 - Construction 
   - Are the seams finished well? You can usually just eye this up. 
   - Extra points for darts or other interesting details!
   - Is the overall shape cool?
- Condition
   - Does it smell musty? How will you get the smell out?
   - Is it ripped or damaged somehow? Not Nice. 
- Manufacturing Location
   - USA, Japan, Italy Made? Nice.
   - Honestly good clothes can be anywhere though, so don't rely on this too much. 
 - Brand
   - A quick Google search can help if you're unfamiliar, but this is usually trend specific.
   - Don't fall for hype too much though. Overpriced Carhartt is a scam.

### Inexpensive

This is all relative. If it's under $20 and I'm on the fence, I'll usually grab it. Why not? I also like to think about cost-per-wear. There are some really awesome pieces out there, but you might just not wear them that often because of the style. If it's something you'll wear all the time, a more expensive item could still be a value buy.

### Examples
I'll follow up this post with some real life thrift examples! There's a lot of stuff out there.
